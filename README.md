# GutmanLabNipypeWorkflows
Generating a repo for various workflows used in my lab that leverage NiPype


Once you've created an environment.. I strongly recommend you use conda/anaconda

Look in requirements.txt

Then create an environment using that

Actual descriptoins on how to do this.. coming soon :-)


source activate dg_niype
